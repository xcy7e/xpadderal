This Application frames the awesome [Xpadder](https://xpadder.com/)-application with new features.
Currently the primary feature is a heads-up display that shows the currently selected xpadder-profile. While switching profiles (hardcoded between "VLC" and "Youtube") you see the selected profile in an overlay. Simple as that.

Although I find this useful, I totally admit this app could need some significant improvements.

**Requires xpadder 5.7 (not shipped)**
Probably needs some small code adjustments when using this on your machine. At least you might want to have a look at the code.
